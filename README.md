 A design for an Audio  Predictor & Generator is proposed. The model is Convolutional Network. It takes  as  an  input  an  audio  file  and  tries  to  predict  the  next sample  in  the  future.  It also generates new samples. I  prepared  a  dataset  to  be  used  in the  experiment.  I  designed  some  basic  building  blocks  for a  basic  audio  predictor and generator.
